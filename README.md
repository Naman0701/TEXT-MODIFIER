Use this website to modify your text,like capitalize first word, remove punctuation marks, etc.
This is my first website using Django so the focus is mainly on it and not on front-end.
This is a fully working website, with front-end and backend.
Django is used in back-end.
To run this,
Goto my-site folder then opwn powershell and run this command
> python manage.py runserver
//The website will go live.
